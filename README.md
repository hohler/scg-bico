# Big Commit Analysis #

## Environment of developer ##
- Eclipse Java EE 4.6
- Tomcat Server 9.0
- MySQL Server 5.7
- Java Version 1.8

## Setup ##

You need a MySQL and a Tomcat Server.

Additional MySQL configuration variables: see chapter 7.

### Outline ###

1. Clone repo
2. Import in Eclipse
3. Update configuration
4. Set up a local Tomcat Server Version >= 6 (Version <= 7 with Eclipse) and add it in the Run Configurations in Eclipse
5. Deploy the project to the Tomcat server
6. Example repositories
7. MySQL configuration
8. Deployment for production environment
9. Ready-to-use VirtualBox VM

## 1. & 2. ##
Trivial
## 3. Update configuration ##
Adapt database parameters in file
`/src/main/resources/application.properties`


	bico.db.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bico?autoReconnect=true
	bico.db.username = bico
	bico.db.password = bico
	bico.db.driverClassName = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver


Adapt path for cloning repositories in file
`/src/main/java/org/springframework/batch/admin/sample/repository/GitLoader.java`

	private static String REPOSITORY_PATH = "target/repositories/";

With Eclipse on Windows, this is equivalent to *C:\eclipse\target\repositories\*

## 4. Install Tomcat and Eclipse Configuration ##
Install Tomcat from [https://tomcat.apache.org](https://tomcat.apache.org). Use Version 8 or 9.

In Eclipse, go to Window -> Show View -> Servers . Then in the servers view, right click and add new. It will show a pop up containing many server vendors. Under Apache select Tomcat v8.0 (Depending upon your downloaded server version). And in the run time configuration point it to the Tomcat folder you have downloaded. 

## 5. Deploy test server ##

After you completed Step 4, you may "Run as" the project, choose "Run on Server" and use your newly created Tomcat server. This way, you don't have to generate a .war file and deploy manually.

After deploying, navigate to [http://localhost:8080/bico/](http://localhost:8080/bico/)

## 7. MySQL Configuration ##
MySQL specific configuration: some patches are too big. You have to set the max_allowed_packets higher in your MySQL Server configuration. e.g. `max_allowed_packet=20M`.

Also, `innodb_buffer_pool_size` should be raised to 32M.

Location of configuration file on Windows: `C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\my.ini`

## 8. Deployment for production environment ##
** Generation of .war file with Maven (in project directory): **

Change the configuration files (see above) according to your environment.

	mvn clean install -X

** Generation of .war file with Eclipse: **

Project -> Run as -> "Maven build..."
-> Goals: clean install -X
-> JRE: set Java 1.8 JDK
-> Execute

** Deploy the .war file to a Tomcat Server. **

.war File is located in /target/

Copy .war file to /webapps/ folder of Tomcat.

Tables for Spring batch should get auto-generated. If not, `db_structure.sql` is included in the base git directory.

Tables for the App itself are not auto-generated by default. If you want that they are auto-generated, go to file `WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml` and set `generateDdl` in entityManagerFactory bean to true. Pay attention: On every app start, the tables are re-created.

I recommend to just import the db_structure.sql and don't touch `generateDdl`.

## 9. Ready-to-use VirtualBox VM ##

Download-Link: [download here](https://mega.nz/#!7txXVLAA!NpQO_EscfeGNQadh66IMdHxAo6U9AyLUctXqbxdvYX4)

Import the appliance with Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

There are two network adapter. One is NAT (eth0) for internet access. The second is "Host-Only" (eth1) for accessing the tool. With a normal VirtualBox installation, the VM should automatically get a local IP.

You can get the IP of eth1 with the command `ifconfig` while logged in on the VM.

Connect to the interface with [http://assigned-ip-address-of-eth1:8080/bico/](http://assigned-ip-address-of-eth1:8080/bico/)

**Accounts**

*bico* : b1c0_2017 (use this account to connect via SSH)

*root* : b1c0_2017

mysql *root* : b1c0_2017

**Details**

Restart services:

`systemctl restart tomcat`
`systemctl restart mysql`
`systemctl restart apache2`
